# Concentration-Card-Game

Welcome to my Concentration memory game that is done with Cards. This game uses 8 cards there are 4 sets that match. The goal of the game is to find the cards that match each other and once doing that you will finish the game. This application was my first game written in Java. It utilizes Images and a multitude of functions. 
The class Game.java was given to those in the class by the professor the only code that was written myself is from lines 97-146.
